If you have VEGA56/64/FE/VII cards i recommend using the 'tweak_profile' parameter because it can increase your hashrate on some algorithms!
For RX series cards, the 'tweak_profile' option can bring some extra hash for your modded GPU.
It can be used on stock bios GPU's too, but the performance will be far from the performance of a modded bios.

Please read these VERY IMPORTANT things:

1. Miner must run with administrator/root privileges
2. Be patient, it takes some time to find optimal settings for your gpu/rig. Always test 1 card at a time.
3. If you start getting invalid shares or compute errors, that means the profile is too much for that gpu, so lower it. Or decrease your memory frequency.

Tweak levels :

0 - no change, uses your original settings
1 - light tweak
2
3
4
10 - max tweak


Not every gpu can handle the same profile, so you need to find the right one for every gpu you have.
Every profile has also weaker (low) settings. To use the low profile, add L after the profile number.

If using gpu setup in cmd it would look like this for example: --gpu-tweak-profile 5L
If using config file, you must surround the value with quotation marks if you want to use the L profile. Example : "5L"

The simplest mode to apply a tweak profile is by using + or - on your keyboard while the miner is running.
