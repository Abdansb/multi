Api has two interfaces : json and gui (over http)

To use it you must enable it first, by using the --api-enable parameter.
Set your rig name with --api-rig-name rig_name.

After you started the miner, you can access the GUI stats in your browser :
http://127.0.0.1:21550/stats

Or the json : http://127.0.0.1:21550


There are also three other parameters that can help you to restart miner, reboot or shutdown your machine remotely :

--api-rig-restart-url
This should be a unique string, which accessed in browser results in a computer restart. Miner needs to have admin privileges.

--api-rig-shutdown-url
This should be a unique string, which accessed in browser results in a computer shutdown. Miner needs to have admin privileges.

--api-miner-restart-url
This should be a unique string, which accessed in browser restarts SRBMiner-MULTI.
